# Module-5-Challenge
UCI data analytics bootcamp module 5 challenge

The folder "Starter_Code/Pymaceuticals" includes all the necessary files for my assignment submission.

The original folder is "Starter_Code" which leads to "Pymaceuticals", and within that folder is a 'data' folder and a 'pymaceuticals_AshleyCanonizado.ipynb' jupyter notebook.

- 'data' includes a 'Mouse_metadata.csv' file and a 'Study_results.csv' file which are the csv data files used for the assignment
- The 'pymaceuticals_AshleyCanonizado.ipynb' file is where I completed all of my work- I started off of the originally provided 'Starter_Code' file and input all of my code and outputs and renamed it.
- The first section of the file is a written report on the data- there includes a summary of each section and graph and a few conclusions I made based on the data. 
- Not including the comments provided by 'starter_code', I added my own comments that include a general idea of what I was looking to achieve with certain parts of code, as well as various other code I had sought to try out but ultimately not ended up using- I leave these commented out here as reference for when I decide to look back at my code when I wish to figure out certain things and remember my work process.

***All of the code within this challenge is either mine or provided by 'starter_code' when I first downloaded the assignment. I made use of Instructor help, former activities/assignments, as well as UCI Bootcampspot's Xpert Learning Assistant, and lastly various documentation (such as pandas) to get help with fixing errors within my code and figuring out different ways to format my infographics.
